# Jacob Garby

Welcome to my Github profile :) I'm currently a 4th year computer science student at the University of Nottingham. My main interests are operating systems, robotics, networks (particularly mobile ad-hoc networks), and electronics design.

My third year dissertation was about a novel method of controlling drones from a central server. The source code for this is on Github [here](https://github.com/j4cobgarby/dronefleet)!

My fourth year dissertation that I'm currently working on is about implementing a ROS interface as a Linux Kernal driver.
