# Jacob Garby

Welcome to my Github profile :) My main broad interests are operating systems and how they deal with concurrency and parallelism, distributed systems, and electronics design. I also like making games, and computer graphics and visualisations.

My website is hosted with Github pages, at https://jgarby.uk.
