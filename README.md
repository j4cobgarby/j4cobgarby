# Jacob Garby

Welcome to my Github profile :) My main broad interests are operating systems/system programming in general, distributed systems, and electronics design. I also like making games, and computer graphics and visualisations.

My third year dissertation was about a novel method of controlling drones from a central server. The source code for this is on Github [here](https://github.com/j4cobgarby/dronefleet)!

My fourth year dissertation was about implementing a Linux interface for accessing ROS nodes from the virtual filesystem, which is spread across [this shared library](https://github.com/j4cobgarby/diss2) and [this application that uses it](https://github.com/j4cobgarby/rosfs).

My website is hosted with Github pages, at https://jgarby.uk.
